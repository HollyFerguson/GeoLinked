# For gbxml, the structural pieces can be associated to both a surface and space and level directly
# For ifcxml, the structural pieces can only be associated to a level as has been found so far
# Thus the options are to add on to level properties if they were already added but since that is not a guarantee,
# We will add level, name of structural piece, coors, etc. as has_level_structure to building level
# So, when asking for structural pieces, must check for both building level AND space level structural components

# For example, this is the best IFC will do for associating items together, given all the spaces and columns and
# windows and doors for a level, they are grouped, but not what spaces the columns each belong to, etc.

# On the other side, gbxml only seems to distinguish between Round or Square Columns, where W-Flange, for ex.
# are not able to be distinguished without heavy geometric analysis, there are mis-tagged as floors, etc.
# gbxml also tends to keep round columns as single entities (one surface definition) where square columns are broken
# down into four different surfaces, where we need to group the data and store all of it as a node for each surface
# part, however for these, we also set each surface to belong to a certain structural CadID for easier grouping
# So far, ifcxml does not break down columns into separate surfaces.
